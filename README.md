The onset of Covid-19 global pandemic presented a number of challenges and uncertainties across all nations. From paralysis of global economies, business activities, human interactions and ultimately mandatory in-house restrictions. With majority of the worldâ€™s population locked up in their homes, mobile phones through social media were the only efficient tool that allowed communication and through which information regarding the pandemic would be shared from different sources to individuals and from person to person. There were several instances where fictious news and information was disseminated and shared to the public through various social media platforms leading to confusion and misinformation among the public. The aim of this paper is to investigate the various misconceptions propagated during spread of Covid-19 information and build a model that correctly predicts if a tweet propagates misconception, is informative by contradicting the misconception or whether it is neither mis-informative nor informative.
